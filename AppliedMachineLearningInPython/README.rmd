In this project we had to create a predictive to see
if a person was more or less likely to pay a blight
ticket based on different features.

I didn't do much fine tuning on the choice of the model
or on the model parameters, as this topic didn't appeal
to me at the time.

Sadly I am unable to find the train and data set provided
(originally in a Jupyter notebook).
