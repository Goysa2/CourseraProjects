For this project, we had to train a model that would predict
if two people were likely to email each other.
The features used, were mostly features from graphs extracted with
NetworkX.


Note that this assignment was done online in a Jupyter notebook.
There might compatibility issues (i.e. doesn't work with NewtorkX
v2.x only with NetworkX v.1.x).
