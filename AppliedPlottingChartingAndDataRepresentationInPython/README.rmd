With this project we had to choose a topic an present a relevant
visualization of that topic following design and visualization
guidelines.

I choose to represent the COVID19 cases in Ann Harbour Michigan.
It is the county where the University of Michigan is located (and
it is the University which offered this MOOC).

The data is being updated regularly therefore the plot
might change.

Originally completed in July 2020.
